## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### Continued development

Will re-develo-p this project in ReactJS.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) - This helped me save time on creating a responsive centred section/ div of the website by using the container attribute to save time rather than using margins to dictate the display of a given section on the page.
